# üîß PDF Upload & Viewing - Setup & Troubleshooting Guide

## ‚úÖ Fixed Issues

### Backend Issues Fixed:
1. **Added static file serving** - PDFs can now be accessed via HTTP
2. **Fixed port configuration** - Backend now defaults to port 5000
3. **Enhanced file upload validation** in resource controller
4. **Added proper error handling** for upload operations

### Frontend Issues Fixed:
1. **Improved file validation** - Better error messages for invalid files
2. **Enhanced UI feedback** - Shows file size and name when selected
3. **Added PDF viewer component** - Modal-based PDF viewing
4. **Better error handling** - More descriptive error messages
5. **Multiple viewing options** - View in modal or download directly

## üöÄ How to Start the Application

### 1. Start Backend Server
```bash
cd Backend
node app.js
```
Should show: `Server running on port 5000` and `MongoDB connected`

### 2. Start Frontend Development Server
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
Should start on `http://localhost:5173`

### 3. Test Upload Functionality
- Open `test-upload.html` in browser for quick testing
- Or use the main app at `http://localhost:5173`

## üîç Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Cannot connect to server"
**Solution:** Make sure backend is running on port 5000
```bash
cd Backend
node app.js
```

### Issue: "File upload failed" 
**Solutions:**
1. Check file is PDF format
2. Check file size < 10MB
3. Ensure uploads folder exists in Backend directory

### Issue: "PDF won't display"
**Solutions:**
1. Check backend static file serving: `http://localhost:5000/uploads/[filename]`
2. Verify CORS settings allow localhost:5173
3. Check browser console for errors

### Issue: "404 Not Found" for uploaded files
**Solutions:**
1. Verify uploads directory exists in Backend folder
2. Check static file middleware is configured
3. Ensure file was actually uploaded (check Backend/uploads folder)
